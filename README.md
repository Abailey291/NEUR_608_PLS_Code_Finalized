# NEUR_608_PLS_Code
This is a GitHub Code for Analyzing fMRI Data and Behavioural Data (actually, any quantitative Y Matrix) using Behavioural-Partial Least Squares

Please note that my code is based on the incredible work of Dr. Peer Herholz (https://peerherholz.github.io/Python_for_Psychologists_Winter2021/showcases/functional_connectivity.html) and was greatly facilitated by Nilearn (https://nilearn.github.io/stable/index.html), and the pyls toobox by Dr. Ross Markello (https://github.com/netneurolab/pypyls)
